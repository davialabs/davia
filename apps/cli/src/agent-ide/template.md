# Davia Documentation

This file contains auto-generated documentation rules for your project.

## Overview

Davia helps you maintain up-to-date internal documentation by analyzing your codebase and generating comprehensive documentation automatically.

## What This Does

When you use this agent, it will have access to your project's documentation structure and guidelines that were generated by Davia. This helps maintain consistency in how you work with your project's documentation.

## Mock Content

This is a placeholder for documentation content that will be populated by Davia. In future versions, this will include:

- Project structure overview
- Key architectural decisions
- API documentation
- Development guidelines
- Best practices specific to your codebase

For now, this serves as a template for agent-specific configuration files.
