Here are the available secondary packages for you to use to build your components:
- react-simple-maps@3.0.0 : ideal for lightweight, SVG-based map visualizations (choropleths, small geo overlays).
(careful to set the geoUrl constant inside the component function)

- usehooks-ts@3.1.1 : React hooks library, written in Typescript and easy to use. It provides a set of hooks that enables you to build your React applications faster.
Do not hesitate to look at the documentation on the internet (use the web search tool) of the packages to see how to use them.
